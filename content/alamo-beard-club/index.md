The Alamo Beard Club promotes facial hair, friendship, and the community of San Antonio.

The Alamo Beard Club was established in July 2012, bringing together a group of appreciators and cultivators of facial hair. The group began as a social club and soon grew to include competitions. Centred around the celebration of facial hair and a strong community charity focus. Alamo Beard Club’s competitions bring together the competitors and spectators to support San Antonio.

Currently, the Alamo Beard Club hosts an annual charity Beard and Moustache competition during San Antonio’s world famous Fiesta, volunteers to support local charities and businesses as well as sends competitors to local, regional and international competitions.
